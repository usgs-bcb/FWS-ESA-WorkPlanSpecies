As part of this, the Biogeographic Characterization Branch has put together a short review of what our process can say about the current state of data for these species. This is based on the Taxa Information Registry module of the Biogeographic Information System, an intelligent platform we are building to bring together all of our work into a cohesive whole.\n",

Staff in the Ecosystems Mission Area put together a spreadsheet that has all of those species but resolves some things to include scientific name and a link to the FWS Ecological Conservation Online system record for the species. This is a really helpful starting point in making sure we have the right taxonomy and links to other systems. To process this, I pulled the links out as a separate column in the spreadsheet and loaded it up into the same folder with this code for processing. We are loading these data into a MongoDB database system we have running on the ESIP Testbed under the DataDistillery project we are continuing to build there.\n",

    "The spreadsheet of species on the petition list included links to the FWS Ecological Conservation Online System for most of the species. After working through a few issues trying to connect to the FWS Threatened and Endangered Species (TESS) API for the species, I found it necessary to scrape the ECOS web pages for some additional information. It turns out that the ECOS system has multiple identifiers for species that seem to be used in various parts of the data model and that are not all readily available through their APIs. The public web pages seem to assemble a lot of this information from various places through a back-end app of some kind, but there is no real API that I could find to work against for everything. In order to reliably understand and work with the connections to other systems that FWS folks have put together, it seemed like we needed to go ahead and parse out some information from the human-readable web pages into usable data. This code does that using BeautifulSoup."
