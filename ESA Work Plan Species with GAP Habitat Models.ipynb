We're currently in the process of spinning this up for production, which will change the interface methods and expose everything via a public API. In the meantime, access is handled through the latest version of the [pybis package](https://github.com/usgs-bis/pybis), which can be installed via pip. The db module in that package requires a set of environment variables with connection information for the database that is only available to our team. You can enter those in a number of ways depending on how you're running Jupyter (virtual environment, etc.), including right here in the notebook using %env magic in a cell."

    "Now that we grabbed up and cached the basic metrics data, we can exploit it to build out a report of some kind. One of the things we might want to look at is any difference in the states for which the GAP models indicate possible species range and what FWS is currently considering the states in the species range. We can now look at that pretty readily with the data we've assembled thus far. This code block simply builds out lists of states provided as species range in the FWS work plan, list of the states where the GAP analysis indicates states with potentially suitable habitat, and compares the two. In cases where the GAP data indicates there may be species range in states not identified as yet in the FWS work plan, I put the GAP metrics data into a dataframe and display it for further discussion."
